MUN is the occasion to live the amazing experience of representing a country in a truly international and multicultural environment, debating over hot topics of the current geopolitical agenda, learning to negotiate and compromise to reach consensus, making new friends. No one needs to be a professional of the international relations, or on diplomacy, it is all about learning. Today you might be delegates in your College, you're learning, getting familiar with the concept, its rules, but who knows maybe tomorrow you will be sitting in New-York or Geneva at the UN's headquarters, small steps guide you to higher places. AMIMUN'17 is your opportunity to learn how to be a delegate and to feel the atmosphere of a MUN. Being helped, supported and surrounded by the AMITY's team, which this year is organizing its 6th MUN but also boosted by Indonesia MUN and Young Leaders' Consortium.

The Model United Nations is an incredibly powerful platform for the youth to understand how the world works and deals with its problems. We cannot, as future world leaders, suggest to build walls as solutions to security threats. We must, instead, find ways to, if not resolve, then at least to endure them together by building bridges and forging lasting and incorruptible relationships. Let's focus on resolving issues that will be discussed over the duration of the conference instead of going back and forth with cause and effect for an unwarranted period of time. I am confident that AMIMUN will prove to be a fine example of the youth's capability to influence and bring about change, as it always has been. I look forward to watching AMIMUN achieve new milestones and setting examples for all other institutions to follow.

MUNs are a powerful tool to create ripples in the mind of the youth about issues further away from home.

It propagates the idea of global community and helps young minds broaden their perspectives on real

world issues that need our attention TODAY. I have been associated with AMIMUN since 2014 and

before it, I was ignorant to how powerful a medium it can be to spark important discussions and ideas.

Since its conception, it has grown every year to become bigger and better. It has always realized the

importance of difficult conversations and unconventional committees. I feel honored to be on the advisory

panel of AMIMUN'17, and hope that it continues to strive to make a real difference.

<p> My journey with MUNs began with AMIMUN 2011, and since then there's been no looking back. I consider it an honor to be a part of AMIMUN'17 as an Advisor. I'm really proud how AMIMUN has become a legacy which has always strived to introduce new ideas, in the form of unconventional committees, which in turn open up an entirely new side of role-based debating. I've been associated with AMIMUN as a delegate, as the Secretary General in 2014, a member of the Executive Board, and as a member of the Advisory Panel, and thus, I can confidently say that AMIMUN has been growing with each year, ever since its inception. I'm really excited about AMIMUN'17 as I'll be chairing the WHO Crisis Committee which is a one-of-it's kind convention of members, and I'm confident this MUN is going to be an absolutely delightful experience for everyone. Cheers! </p>
